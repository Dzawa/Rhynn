How to initialize the database
* Open a command prompt and change the working directory to Rhynn/server/MinServer/_db
* Type the following commands and replace <username> with your appropriate MySQL user name:
 * mysql  -u <username> -p < init.sql
 * mysql  -u <username> -p fw_core < fw_core.sql
 * mysql  -u <username> -p fws_messages < fws_messages.sql

You will be prompted for your password and if the scripts are read into MySQL successfully you should have all the required data.
